        <p>I am a resourceful and results-driven Administrative Professional with over 10 years of experience supporting senior-level
executives and managing office operations across diverse industries. Expertise in human resources, payroll, event
coordination, and process improvement. I am currently a part-time student studying web development and am excited to make connections while embarking on my newest professional journey. In my personal time, I foster young and at-risk kittens, which has developed my sense of empathy and ability to relate to an individual on a personal level.</p>
